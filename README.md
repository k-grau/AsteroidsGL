# AsteroidsGL

Simple remake of the classical game [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) for Android. 

Developed 2019 as part of the course ["Game Development for Android"](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/freestanding-courses/course/?kKod=5SD812&typ=1) at Uppsala University, Sweden. 

Development was done from a shared codebase where my task was to implement features such as music and sound effects, HUD, score tracking, asteroid speed, player firing etc.

Language of the app is English.

Target SDK version is 30 and the project is currently NOT maintained or updated.
